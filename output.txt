Abstract

Social media usage is increasing day by day in Sri Lanka. It became the largest news-
sharing media among the young generation. This research paper is about the investigation
of social media behavior and its impact on ethnic issues in Sri Lanka. The majority of Sri
Lankans are Buddhists and there are two major minorities such as Tamil and Muslim.
The main aim was to identify social media behavior and how it makes an impact on
ethnic issues in Sti Lanka. The main research question was whether social media

reporting has an impact on religious conflicts.

This is a mix of methodological research. The data was collected through questionnaires
and interviews. The sample is 150 from 4 main provinces such as western, southern,
eastern and central Sri Lanka. This research mainly indicated that the social media has
good freedom to majority and minority to make their voices on the same platform.
Moreover it indicate the social media create like hood sub groups and it creates
distractions in the society. In other hand the results indicate that the social media can
create more negative impact subjectively. Furthermore indicates that it can increase the
conflict situations as it could create different news without accuracy. It was very
interesting to find out that the social groups trust the news and the online chatter on social

media more than the traditional media in Sri Lanka in the case of ethnic issues.
